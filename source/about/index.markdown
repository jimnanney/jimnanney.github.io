My name is Jim Nanney.  I love to play with computers and make them do incredible things.  I've done many things with computers since I was a young kid in the early 80s.  My first computer was purchased in 1980 and had so little room on it that this page wouldn't even fit. I am also a father of 3 wonderful girls and a husband to the most intelligent, beautiful, creative woman in the world.

In the past I have done many things, and seem to have become a jack of all trades. I have run BBSs (pre-internet message boards).  I have been a systems admin and network admin. And yes, I have some pretty good linux chops.  I got my RHCE in 2010.  I have written C and assembly code.  I have built hardware devices including my own VGA card. I've developed firmware for several hardware projects.

Currently, I live in Biloxi, MS and work as a developer building web applications.  As a hobbyist, I build iphone apps and am in the process of learning Ruby and Rails.  Ruby seems to be the most fun language I have ever dealt with and the Ruby community is fantastic.  I had the pleasure of attending RubyConf 2012 and even brought my wife along.  It peaked her interest, and completely changed my whole outlook.

I am working toward learning and mastering Ruby and hope to share my knowledge along the way here.
