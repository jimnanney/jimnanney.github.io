    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Vim adventures has taught me an incredible new (to me) trick.  The ability to paste a previously deleted line is easy.  Use <strong>p</strong> or <strong>P</strong> to paste it.  But what if it was the third time you hit <strong>dd</strong> and you wanted to paste in the first thing you deleted.  I cannot begin to count the number of times I needed to do that.  Further down, I'll reveal this secret, but first the backstory:</p>

<p>Recently I saw a link to http://vim-adventures.com and followed.  It was appealing, but seemed basic in the first three levels.  So I decided not to purchase the subscription.</p>

<p>And then, at Rails Conf 2013 in Portland, I met up with a friend who was working through one of the levels.  I immediately asked if she was playing vim adventures and she said yes and that she was stuck.  Of course I offered to assist.  This proved several points to me right away.</p>

<p>First, I am not as good with VIM as I had thought.
Second, I am a horrible teacher of things I have little grasp on.
Third, Vim Adventures advances terribly quick after level 3 and is well worth the subscription.</p>

<p>It was inevitable afterwards that I subscribed.  I have learned a ton, and the most profound ended up being the automatic buffers.</p>

<p>Here's how they work:</p>

<p>Given these lines:</p>

<ol>
<li>Delete me last</li>
<li>Delete me third.</li>
<li>Delete me first.</li>
</ol>


<p>If you delete line three by using <strong>dd</strong>, followed by line 1 with another <strong>dd</strong> and then line 2 with again a <strong>dd</strong>, several deletion registers would be created.</p>

<p>You can see these by typing <strong>:reg</strong></p>

<p>First, notice they are numbered from <strong>"0</strong> to <strong>"9</strong> and that they are in order from first in to last in. They also rotate out as more are added.</p>

<p>So to paste the first deletion from above, you would use <strong>"3</strong>p</p>

<p>This simple thing has bothered me many times, but not enough to look it up. After playing vim adventures to level 10, I've learned this new trick.</p>
